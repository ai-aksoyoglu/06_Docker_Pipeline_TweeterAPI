Alphandra Slackbot:

- basic info: https://api.slack.com/apps/A01NZT8ST5X
- webhook location: [https://api.slack.com/apps/A01NZT8ST5X/incoming-webhooks?](https://api.slack.com/apps/A01NZT8ST5X/incoming-webhooks?) (the "add new webhook to workspace" button will add the bot to a channel and create a link to use in docker-compose)
